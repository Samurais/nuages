This directory contains contour data extracted mostly from
tomographic images. We used it to test our 3D reconstruction
method. Sometimes it was a major problem to find suitable
data, and by making our set accessable we hope to do an
useful contribution to the development of 3D reconstruction.

We think it is a good idea to test different reconstruction
methods with the same data. In this way the results may be
compared.

Most data was extracted manually, which is a time consuming
work. If you use the data in publications, please include an
acknowledgement.


Feedback is welcome; also we would be grateful if you could
contribute with some of your own contour sets to enlarge
this collection. Please send contour data, questions,
remarks, etc. to the address below.

head1
-----
17 cross-sections of head and brain. From MRI data.

torus
-----
Synthetic cross-sections of a torus. Useful
for accuracy tests.

pelvis1

23 cross-sections of a pelvis. Manually extracted from MRI-Images.

skull
_____
113 cross-sections of a skull, obtained by thresholding from the
UNC Chapel Hill Volume Rendering Test Dataset.


data format:
============
We use a simple ASCII format that may be easily adapted to
any other format. The contours are given by simple closed
polygons. One cross-section may contain several such polygons,
possibly some lying inside others. They are oriented in a way
that the inside of a contour (material) is on its righthand side.
The xy-coordinates are in the range of [0..512].
Example:

S 23            /* number of cross-sections = 23*/
V 34  z 14.7    /* first cross-section: 34 vertices, z = 14.7 */
{               /* first contour */
246.00 164.00   /* x y coordinates */
236.00 166.00
233.00 181.00
216.00 218.00
 .
 .
 .
}               /* end of first contour */
{               /* second contour */
 .
 .
 .
}               /* end of second contour */
V 21  z 28.4    /* second cross-section: 21 vertices, z = 28.4 */
