This version is not compatible with older versions.
Major changes :

-new input file format for contours (one file instead of two)
 A tool to convert from old to new format is provided (r2e).

-internal vertices are added by default. One single run
 of repros is sufficient.

-the pixel-contour approximation is done by the prepros preprocessor.

-the default output format of repros2visu is wavefront .obj format.

-connected component numbering in repros2tetra is now ok.

-call_repros is now called nuages

-the number of detected ancient bugs may be equal to the number of
 newly implemented bugs.
